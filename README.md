Smiley 

Smiley is a new Programing language with a complete new syntax construction, that contains smilies for for every statement, this makes the code shorter and cleaner. Also are higher lever function names mixed up with for example simple for loops key words.

Emotion 

Last but not least with smilies we are symbolizing emotions. Code isn’t dusty any more you can feel it, it gets a touch of human interaction. You are prevent yourself to become a super duper unemotional computer nerd. You don’t have to feel sorry anymore about you missing human interaction, “smiley” will compensate this for you.

Note: This language want to be something special and different, so the thinks of higher programming language are indented to came in this language different, with there own pros cons. This means the language will only have the real basics implemented, for now.

Basic syntax

In smiley everything starts with a simple emoji. Every smiley is an unique indicator for a instruction to the PC, like for declaration, loops, arrays and so on. 

Comments are something we feel bad about, nobody like it to be ignored, it is mainly bad. We as programmers are feeling real misery. We show our sympathy to such a misbehavior with a sad smiley. 

:( this text is ignored :(

Variable declaration is simply  positive, so the emoji too. It starts with a smiley then the identifier and ends with with the value of the variable. And no one cares about if you type is integer ore what ever, this language is not type save. The identifier can be anything, it just must start and end with a  white space, in it shouldn't be white spaces. The variable shouldn't start with a number.

:) someInteger 123 <br>
:) string “hallo”

As you see the language is line sensitive and has no semicolons.

There is nothing cooler then showing what you got. Printing something is boss like. So to print something start with the boss emoji then the identifier which value will be printed.

:) someValue “Hallo Welt” <br>
B) someIdentifier

To get user input is kind of cool too. Just do the extended cool emoji then a identifier to store and
to get the value.

B-) someIdentifier

Calculating  things is just brutal boring. So to do so we have hybrid sad with the operand in the middle. And after this leave a space and then put the two value separated by a white space after that.
The last must be a identifier of an variable. 

:+S 123 plus2 <br> 
:-S minus1 minus2 <br>
:*S mult1 mult2 <br>
:/S div1 div2

If your program gets more complex, and the identifier could be mix up, in general you want order. Because  you surround you particular code, it’s like hugging, we use the hugging emoji. The instruction should like all instruction be in its own line.
```
><  :( my own invention of a hugging emoji :( 
	:) text “Hello World I am nested in a block" 
	B) text        :( this prints the text right above :( 
<> :( a twisted hug emoji :( 

B) text :(  this will give an error, becouse text is in its own name space :( 
```
Hint: you cant coppy this do to weird formatting.

Arrays in this language have no extra implementation. Do to the fact that every individual identifier can point to a value. So you can just pretend that arrays are implemented. And just write human[0] and reference to this with human[0] again.
```
:) human[id] “value” 
B) human[id]
```
Boolishe types are represented with a b in the smiley emoji. Don’t forget to separate everything with white spaces. 
```
:b) identifier value == 1
:b) identifier 2 < 1
:b) identifier true
:b) identifier false
```
The if statement is unsure where to process you code. So its an unsure emoji, followed by a block.
```
:/ boolIdentifier
><
	:( some statement : (
<>
```

Which loops are something that repeats its self on and on, like a heart, so we you the heart emoji.
Followed by a block.
```
<* boolIdentifier
><
	:( some instructions : (
<>
```
The loop will gos on as the bool identifier stays true.
